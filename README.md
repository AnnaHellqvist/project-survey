# Survey form with React

The assignment was to make a survey to practice using React and state hooks. The user will answer a couple of questions and them view a summary of those answers :star:

## The problem

### Tech I've used/practiced :collision:
- React / State Hooks
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Animation
- Accessibility

Started building the form structure in the App.js. When the form worked as I wanted it to I continued by breaking out certain elements to their own components, for example the button. 
If I had more time I would've added some more questions to practice different form elements and styling forms.

## View it live :tada:
